  Abstract                 = {Despite the huge popularity of event processing nowadays, there is a big gap between the potential usefulness of event-driven processing and the current state of the practice. One of the main reasons is the lack of a comprehensive conceptual model for the event-triggered reactivity and the corresponding framework for its management. In this paper we survey the current state of the art in event-driven architecture with special focus on event and action processing. We describe the prerequisites of a completely novel conceptual model for describing reactivity that is more close to the way people react on events: based on the ability to identify the context during which active behavior is relevant and the situations in which it is required. This approach opens a completely new view on the event processing as the way for managing a very valuable knowledge asset of every enterprise - knowledge how to react (make decisions) in event-driven situations},

  Review                   = {Review 1: The paper is well written. Nevertheless, the message of the paper is not new and realy new aspect of event triggering are missing (using Gartner slides on page 13/15 seems not to be adaequate) Review 2: The paper surveys the current state of the art in event-driven processing with special focus on event and action processing. The work is motivated with necessity to introduces a kind of reactive dynamics in business systems, and hence to depart from classical, "workflow-driven" business systems. Further on, the paper derives prerequisites and describes a novel conceptual model for describing reactivity that is more close to the way people react on events. The model is given by introducing concepts such as the context and situations. Though the introduced concepts as well as the model itself are clearly needed in event-driven business process systems, authors are encouraged to further concretize on these issues. Also the current analysis is clearly divided between, so called, logical and non-logical approach to handle EtR. Therefore it would be helpful to come up with a list of desired features representing rather a derivation of those two approaches.},
